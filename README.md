# HockeyStats
Collection of Python Jupyter Notebooks that provide Hockey Stat information


## PDO
Calculates the PDO for each team.  More information on PDO can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics_(ice_hockey))

## HockeyStats
Loads all the hockey skater information since 1917 and prints out some interesting facts.  Mostly its a playground for me to learn pandas.
